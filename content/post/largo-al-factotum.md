My (nick)name is Figaro and I'm a Software Engineer and I _love_ being one.
For years I told myself I would have started a blog when I had something cool
to _show off_ and discuss. Many projects have been completed, some failed,
and a lot of lessons have been learnt, but no blog post was written and
knowledge shared. So, I decided to try a completely different strategy:
I'll write a blog post while I work on a project or as soon as I learn
something interesting.

Let's define what I mean with _project_. Obviously a project can be
some code I write and I'd like to talk about (eg a library written in X
to do Y), but it can be anything new I'd like to learn or some knowledge
I want to extend (eg understanding how this new cool messaging system works or
using a new arcane git command).

Hopefully, I'll write something other people will find useful and
I'll get to learn more from the comments. S

_Why "TheFactotum"?_ It means _who does all kinds of work_ which is an
accurate description of what a full-stack developer is supposed to to
(and also because I like opera).
